## Summary
Our team will be working on predicting house prices using the `2023 Property Tax Assessment` dataset from Strathcona County Open Data portal<cite>@strathcona2023</cite>. The dataset provides a wealth of information about houses, including attributes like size, location, and other features. By leveraging this data, we aim to build a robust predictive model that accurately estimates house values.

## Introduction

The team will be using `Ridge` which is a linear model to predict the value of houses. `Ridge` is a regularization model that is used for predictive modeling and mitigates over fitting, improves model stability especially when features are highly correlated<cite>@ridge1992</cite>. Ridge helps create robust model that generalize well to new data.
The question we aim to answer: 
    Can we predict house prices using publicly available housing data , and which features most influence the predictions?
This research is significant as understanding housing prices plays a critical role in assessing broader economic trends, identifying market patterns, and addressing housing affordability issues. Accurate price predictions can help promote transparency and stability in the housing market, which benefits individuals and the economy as a whole.

Data description: 
For this project we are going to use the  `2023 Property Tax Assessment` from Strathcona County Open Data portal<cite>@strathcona2023</cite>. The data set contains the following attributes related to the different houses. The variables we selected for the model are: <br>
                `meters` - numeric variable that show the size of the house <br>
                `garage` - categorical variable where Y means there is a garage and N means no garage. <br>
                `firepl` - categorical variable where Y means there is a fireplace and N means no fireplace<br>
                `bdevl` - categorical variable where Y meas the building was evaluated and N means it was not evaluated<br>
The data set was chosen for its rich feature set, adequate sample size, and public availability making it suitable for building a predictive model. 


## Methods & Results
We used `Ridge` Regression to predict house values based on features such as building size, garage presence, and building evaluation. Ridge regression, as outlined by <cite>@ridge1992</cite>, is particularly useful in addressing multicollinearity. Model selection and evaluation were facilitated by Scikit-Learn's robust tools <cite>@scikit2024</cite>. Exploratory visualizations were created using Altair <cite>@altair2024</cite>. The report is generated using tools Quart <cite>@quarto2024</cite>.

### 1. Import all the necessary libraries for data analysis

    - pandas
    - numpy
    - sklearn.model_selection
    - altair
    - os

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
#import altair_ally as aly
import altair as alt
import os
```

### 2. Read in dataset
We read the CSV file named `2023 Property Tax Assessment` into a pandas DataFrame and filters it to include only the features we are going to evaluate<cite>@strathcona2023</cite>. The resulting DataFrame contains the specific features for further analysis.
@tbl-housing-data displays the first few rows of the dataset after filtering for the relevant columns.


```{python}
#| label: tbl-housing-data
#| tbl-cap: "Preview of the 2023 Property Tax Assessment dataset after selecting relevant columns."
url = "https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v3/datasets/e3c5b04fccdc4ddd88059a8c0b6d8160_0/downloads/data?format=csv&spatialRefId=3776&where=1%3D1"
housing_df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Saves the dataframe to .csv in the data/ directory
housing_df.to_csv("../data/2023_Property_Tax_Assessment.csv")

# Takes only the columns we need
housing_df = housing_df[['meters','garage','firepl','bsmt','bdevl','assess_2022']]

housing_df.head(10)
```

For the beginning exploratory data analysis, we performed data validation checks to ensure the following:

    - Correct data file format
    - Correct column names
    - No empty observations
    - Missingness not beyond expected threshold
    - Correct data types in each column
    - No duplicate observations
    - No outlier or anomalous values

Listed below is the results for our validation check.

```{python}
# Validation for correct data file format
file_path = "data/2023_Property_Tax_Assessment.csv"

if not file_path.endswith(".csv"):
    raise ValueError("File format not supported.")
else: 
    print("✅ File format validation passed: File is a CSV.")

# Validation for correct column names
expected_cols = {"meters", "garage", "firepl", "bsmt", "bdevl", "assess_2022"}
actual_cols = set(housing_df.columns)

if actual_cols == expected_cols:
    print("✅ Column name validation passed: All expected columns are present.")
else:
    missing = expected_cols - actual_cols
    extra = actual_cols - expected_cols
    print("Column names validation failed:")
    if missing:
        print(f" Missing columns: {missing}")
    if extra:
        print(f" Extra columns: {extra}")

# Validation for No Empty Observations
empty = housing_df.isna().all(axis = 1).sum()

if empty == 0:
    print("✅ Empty observations validation passed: No empty rows.")
else:
    print(f" Empty observations validation failed: Found {empty} empty rows.")

#Validation for missingness not beyond expected threshold
expected_threshold = 0
missing = housing_df.isna().mean()

all_cols_passed = True

for col, percentage in missing.items():
    if percentage > expected_threshold:
        all_cols_passed = False
        print(f"Column '{col}' exceeds the missingness expected threshold ({percentage:.2%} missing).")
if all_cols_passed:
    print(f"✅ Missingness validation passed for all columns.")

#Validation for correct data types in each column 

expected_dtypes = { "meters": "float64","garage": "object","firepl": "object","bsmt": "object", "bdevl": "object","assess_2022": "int64"}

dtype_passed = True

for col, dtype in expected_dtypes.items():
    if housing_df[col].dtypes != dtype:
        dtype_passed = False
        print(f"Data type validation failed: Column '{col}' is of type {housing_df[col].dtypes}, expected {dtype}.")
if dtype_passed:
    print("✅ Data type validation passed for all columns.")

# Validation for no duplicate observations
duplicates = housing_df.duplicated().sum()

if duplicates == 0:
    print("✅ Duplicate observation validation passed: No duplicate rows found.")
else:
    print(f"Duplicate observation validation failed: Found {duplicates} duplicate rows.")
    # Dropping duplicates
    housing_df = housing_df.drop_duplicates()
    print("✅ Duplicates have been removed from the DataFrame.")

# Validation for no outliers or anomalous values
outliers_detected = False
outlier_threshold = 5000

# Identify and drop outliers if the threshold is exceeded
for col in housing_df.select_dtypes(include=["float64", "int64"]).columns:
    q1 = housing_df[col].quantile(0.25)
    q3 = housing_df[col].quantile(0.75)
    iqr = q3 - q1
    lower_bound = q1 - 1.5 * iqr
    upper_bound = q3 + 1.5 * iqr

    outliers = housing_df[(housing_df[col] < lower_bound) | (housing_df[col] > upper_bound)]
    num_outliers = len(outliers)
    
    if num_outliers > outlier_threshold:
        outliers_detected = True
        print(f"Outlier validation failed: Column '{col}' has {num_outliers} outliers (threshold: {outlier_threshold}).")
        # Dropping the outliers
        housing_df = housing_df[~((housing_df[col] < lower_bound) | (housing_df[col] > upper_bound))]
        print(f"✅ Outliers in column '{col}' have been removed from the DataFrame.")
    elif num_outliers > 0:
        print(f"Warning: Column '{col}' has {num_outliers} outliers, within acceptable threshold ({outlier_threshold}).")

if not outliers_detected:
    print("✅ Outlier validation passed: No columns exceed the outlier threshold.")
else:
    print("✅ Outliers exceeding the threshold have been removed.")
```

### 3. Visualization for categorical features

We have enabled `VegaFusion` to optimize `Altair` data transformations for visualizations<cite>@altair2024</cite>. We then created a distribution plot of categorical features in the `housing_df` DataFrame.
As shown in @fig-categorical-features, the distribution of categorical features provides insights into their overall counts.

![Distribution of categorical features (Garage, Fireplace, Basement, and Building Evaluation).](../results/figures/categorical_features_counts.png){#fig-categorical-features width=80%}


The scatter plots visualize the relationship between house assessment values (`assess_2022`) and four categorical features: `garage`, `firepl`, `bsmt`, and `bdevl`.
As depicted in @fig-assessment-categorical, the scatter plots illustrate the relationship between house value assessments and categorical features.

![Scatter plots showing house value assessments for categorical features: Garage, Fireplace, Basement, and Building Evaluation.](../results/figures/categorical_features_scatter.png){#fig-assessment-categorical width=80%}


### 4. Prepare data for training and create column transformer for feature transformation

Visualizing the distribution of the target variable, `assess_2022`, using a histogram and Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plot is a crucial step in data exploration. It helps us understand the overall distribution, identify patterns such as skewness, kurtosis, or multiple peaks, and detect outliers. By comparing the histogram and KDE, we can assess if the distribution meets the assumptions of our chosen modeling techniques. This visualization also guides decisions about preprocessing, such as applying transformations to address skewness or choosing the right algorithm for modeling. Additionally, it can uncover data quality issues, like sparse regions or missing values, prompting necessary corrections.

As depicted in @fig-property-assessment-distribution, the combined visualizations provide valuable insights into the distribution and relationship between property sizes (meters) and house assessment values (`assess_2022`). The scatter plot showcases how larger properties tend to have higher assessment values, while the histogram and KDE plot reveal the overall distribution and density of assessment values in the dataset.

![Distribution and relationships of house assessment values (2022), showing scatter plot, histogram, and kernel density estimation.](../results/figures/distribution_charts.png){#fig-property-assessment-distribution width=80%}


According to the scatter plot, the vast majority of our data points are concentrated within the `0 < meters < 2000 range`, with some more within the `2000 < meters < 5000` range, and there are a few outliers in the `meters > 5000` range that make it difficult to get a closer look on the majority of our data. We can see a similar story on the `assess_2022` feature as it has the vast majority of points in the low-mid range and some outlying extreme values.


We have splited the housing_df DataFrame into training and test datasets using an `70-30 split`, categorized features into categorical features (e.g., `garage`, `firepl`, `bsmt`, `bdevl`) and numeric features (e.g., `meters`), applied one-hot encoding transforamtion for categorical features and standardScalar transformation for numeric features by using Scikit-learn<cite>@scikit2024</cite>. We then created a column transformer `preprocessor` through combining these transforamtions to apply to the dataset and visualizes the `preprocessor`.

We performed analysis to identify any potential issues with the relationships between features and the target, as well as between the features themselves. By detecting anomalous correlations, we can uncover redundant or highly correlated features that might lead to multicollinearity, which can negatively affect the performance of machine learning models. In particular, removing or adjusting features that are too strongly correlated ensures that the model can learn meaningful, independent relationships, improving its generalization ability and interpretability. Additionally, examining correlations helps us assess if certain features are disproportionately influencing the target variable, which could indicate bias or overfitting.

```{python}
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(housing_df, test_size=0.3, random_state=123)
```

```{python}
from sklearn.compose import make_column_transformer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler

# Lists of feature names
categorical_features = ['garage', 'firepl', 'bsmt', 'bdevl']
numeric_features = ['meters']
# Create the column transformer
preprocessor = make_column_transformer(
    (OneHotEncoder(), categorical_features),  # One-hot encode categorical columns
    (StandardScaler(), numeric_features),  # Standardize numeric columns
)

# Show the preprocessor
preprocessor
```

#### Validation step

- Check for correct category levels (i.e., no string mismatches or single values)

```{python}
# Define the categorical features and their expected values
categorical_features = ['garage', 'firepl', 'bsmt', 'bdevl']
expected_values = {'Y', 'N'}

# Initialize a flag to track validation status
all_categories_valid = True

# Validate each categorical feature in the train_df
for feature in categorical_features:
    unique_values = set(train_df[feature].dropna().unique())  # Get unique values excluding NaNs
    unexpected_values = unique_values - expected_values  # Find unexpected values

    if unexpected_values:
        print(f"❌ Unexpected values in column '{feature}' in train_df: {unexpected_values}")
        all_categories_valid = False
    else:
        print(f"✅ Category levels validation passed for column '{feature}' in train_df.")

# Final message
if all_categories_valid:
    print("✅ All categorical columns in train_df have the expected levels ('Y' and 'N').")
else:
    print("❌ Some categorical columns in train_df have unexpected values. Please review.")
```

#### Check for anomalous correlations between target and features

```{python}
# Apply preprocessing to train_df
transformed_train = preprocessor.fit_transform(train_df)

# Add the target variable back to the DataFrame
transformed_train_df = pd.DataFrame(transformed_train)
transformed_train_df.columns = ['Garage_Y', 'Garage_N', 'Fireplace_Y', 'Fireplace_N','Basement_Y', 'Basement_N',
                                'BuildingEva_Y', 'BuildingEva_N','meters']
# Add the target column back (assess_2022) to the transformed DataFrame
transformed_train_df['assess_2022'] = train_df['assess_2022']

# Compute correlation with the target variable
correlation_with_target = transformed_train_df.corr()["assess_2022"].drop("assess_2022")

# Identify features with anomalous correlations (correlation > 0.9 or < -0.9)
threshold = 0.9
anomalous_features = correlation_with_target[
    (correlation_with_target.abs() > threshold)
]

if anomalous_features.empty:
    print("✅ No anomalous correlations found between target and features.")
else:
    print("❌ Anomalous correlations detected:")
    print(anomalous_features)
```

#### Check for anomalous correlations between features

```{python}
correlation_matrix = transformed_train_df.corr()
threshold = 0.9

# Define pairs of features that are binary inverses of each other (which are expected to be highly correlated)
exclude_pairs = [
    ('Garage_Y', 'Garage_N'),
    ('Fireplace_Y', 'Fireplace_N'),
    ('Basement_Y', 'Basement_N'),
    ('BuildingEva_Y', 'BuildingEva_N')
]

# Flag to check if any anomalous correlations were found
anomalous_correlations_found = False

# Iterate over the correlation matrix to check for high correlations
for col1 in correlation_matrix.columns:
    for col2 in correlation_matrix.columns:
        if col1 != col2:
            # Skip pairs that are binary inverses
            if (col1, col2) in exclude_pairs or (col2, col1) in exclude_pairs:
                continue
            # Check if correlation is above threshold
            if abs(correlation_matrix[col1][col2]) > threshold:
                print(f"Warning: High correlation detected between {col1} and {col2}.")
                anomalous_correlations_found = True

# If no anomalous correlations are found, print the confirmation message
if not anomalous_correlations_found:
    print("✅ No anomalous correlations found between target and features.")
```

**Note:** When performing correlation analysis on the dataset, it is important to exclude pairs of binary features that are inherently correlated due to their inverse relationship. For example, in the case of features like `Garage_Y` and `Garage_N`, one feature will always be 1 when the other is 0, and vice versa. These binary features are designed to represent the same information in different forms, and their high correlation is expected. Thus, it is not an anomaly and should not be flagged as such. To address this, we exclude these pairs from the correlation analysis, ensuring that only truly anomalous correlations—those that do not follow expected patterns—are identified. By doing so, we can avoid mistakenly flagging normal relationships between inverse binary features while still identifying potential issues in the remaining feature correlations.

### 5. Train, cross validate and evaluate a Ridge regression model

We have splited the features and target variable (`assess_2022`) into training and testing datasets.

```{python}
X_train = train_df.drop(columns=["assess_2022"])
X_test = test_df.drop(columns=["assess_2022"])
y_train = train_df["assess_2022"]
y_test = test_df["assess_2022"]
```

We have created a pipeline combining the column transformer (`preprocessor`) and the Ridge Regression model<cite>@ridge1992</cite>. Using 5-fold cross-validation on the training data, we evaluated the pipeline on multiple metrics and computes train and validation scores. Finally, it outputs the aggregated train and validation scores to assess the model's performance<cite>@scikit2024</cite>.
@tbl-cross-validation-results summarizes the cross-validation results, including the mean and standard deviation of train and validation scores across 5 folds.

```{python}
#| label: tbl-cross-validation-results
#| tbl-cap: "Cross-validation results showing the mean and standard deviation for train and validation scores across 5 folds."
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.model_selection import (
    cross_val_score,
    cross_validate
)
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

# The Ridge model pipeline
pipeline = make_pipeline(preprocessor, Ridge())

# The mean and std of the cross validated scores for all metrics as a dataframe
cross_val_results = pd.DataFrame(cross_validate(pipeline, X_train, y_train, cv=5, return_train_score=True)).agg(['mean', 'std']).round(3).T

# Show the train and validation scores
cross_val_results
```

We fit the pipeline on the training dataset (`X_train` and `y_train`) to train the Ridge Regression model<cite>@ridge1992</cite>. Then evaluates the trained pipeline on the test dataset (`X_test` and `y_test`) which calculates the R² (coefficient of determination) to measure how well the model explains the variance in the test data.

```{python}
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
pipeline.score(X_test, y_test)
```

### 6. Predict housing prices with new data

We created a Pandas DataFrame containing information about 10 houses that we wish to predict the value of.
@tbl-ten-houses summarizes the attributes of ten houses, including property size and various categorical features, used for predictions.

```{python}
#| label: tbl-ten-houses
#| tbl-cap: "Attributes of ten houses used for prediction."
ten_houses = {
    'meters' : [174.23, 132.76, 90.82, 68.54, 221.30, 145.03, 102.96, 164.28, 142.79, 115.94],
    'garage' : ['Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'N', 'Y', 'N', 'N', 'Y', 'N', 'Y'],
    'firepl' : ['Y', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'Y', 'N', 'N', 'Y', 'Y', 'N'],
    'bsmt' : ['Y', 'Y', 'N', 'N', 'Y', 'N', 'Y', 'N', 'Y', 'Y', ],
    'bdevl' : ['N', 'Y', 'Y', 'N', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'N', 'N', 'Y', ]
    }

X_predict = pd.DataFrame(ten_houses)
X_predict
```

We applied the trained pipeline to predict housing prices values based on the features in the dataFrame containing new data <cite>@hastie2009</cite>. The predictions are stored in a new pandas DataFrame.

```{python}
y_predict = pipeline.predict(X_predict)
y_predict = pd.DataFrame(y_predict)
y_predict.columns = ['Predicted_Values']
y_predict = round(y_predict, 2)
```

We combined the original features from the new data and the predicted values into a new pandas DataFrame. The new pandas DataFrame provides an overview of the predictions.
@tbl-predicted-values displays the predicted house values for the ten houses based on their attributes, including property size and categorical features.

```{python}
#| label: tbl-predicted-values
#| tbl-cap: "Predicted house values for the ten houses based on their attributes."
predictions_df = pd.concat([X_predict,y_predict], axis = 1)

# Saves prediction to a csv file
predictions_df.to_csv("../data/ten_houses_predictions.csv")

predictions_df
```

### 7. Visualization for predictions

We have created line charts to visualize the relationship between property size (`meters`) and predicted housing prices (`Predicted_Values`), colored by different categorical features. This visualization highlights how categorical features interact with property size to influence predicted house values<cite>@altair2024</cite>.
As shown in @fig-property-size-correlation, property size has a significant impact on house value predictions, with notable variations across categorical features.

![Line charts showing correlations between property size and house value predictions, colored by various categorical features.](../results/figures/predictions_visualization.png){#fig-property-size-correlation width=80%}


## Discussion
Our findings suggest that the aforementioned 10 houses are expected to be valued at: 

```{python}
y_predict
```


We have also noticed that there is a correlation between a house's price and its property's size, whether or not it has a garage, fireplace, basement, and whether or not the building has been evaluated.
This is consistent with our expectations as the larger a property is, and the more features it has (basement, garage, etc.) the higher its value becomes<cite>@garage2024</cite>.
This also raises further questions such as what other features of a house or property affect its value? characteristics for future consideration include: Number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, indoor space, outdoor space, and number of floors.

### Limitations
While the model performs well, several limitations need to be addressed:

1. Assumptions of Ridge Regression:
Ridge regression assumes linear relationships between features and the target variable. While effective in addressing multicollinearity, it may fail to capture complex, non-linear interactions in the data.
The regularization term could over-penalize certain features, potentially underestimating their influence.

2. Dataset Assumptions:
The analysis assumes independence between observations, which might not hold if regional trends or external factors influence house prices.
While preprocessing addressed issues like missing values, duplicates, and outliers, any inaccuracies or biases in the original data could impact the model's predictions.

3. Feature Selection:
The model is limited to the selected features (meters, garage, firepl, bsmt, bdevl), which do not comprehensively represent all factors affecting house prices. Features like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, or outdoor space could improve the model’s performance.

### Future Work
To address these limitations, future iterations could incorporate non-linear models such as decision trees or ensemble methods to capture more complex relationships. Including additional features like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, or proximity to amenities could further refine the predictions. Spatial modeling or time-series analysis might also better account for dependencies in the data.

By acknowledging these limitations and proposing improvements, this project lays the groundwork for future enhancements in house price prediction.
